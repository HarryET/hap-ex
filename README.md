# HAP

HAP is a framework for builting HAP (aka HomeKit) devices under Apple's
'Hobbyists and Makers' guidelines. You can think of it as [homebridge](https://www.github.com/nfarina/homebridge)
for Elixir. 

## Installation

TBD. Likely the core of this will end up being a Hex package that you pull into
a project similar to Phoenix. That approach would allow for easy integration with
Nerves, which is the most common use case for this library.
